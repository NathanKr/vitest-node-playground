<h2>Motivation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Show that vitest can work also on non vite project e.g. node.js and the configuratio</li>
<li>Show that project with es module and typescript can be tested simply by installing vitest (compare with jest ....)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Limitation</h2>
for some reason the test with fetch is failing when all tests are running. After h -> f it works ok in general
